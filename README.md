# na-preprocessed
Hosting for preprocessed data sets in the Na language, for use in NLP. The original data are online in [the "Na" repository on GitHub](https://github.com/alexis-michaud/na) and the audio is online in the Pangloss Collection (instructions for batch download are available [here](https://github.com/CNRS/Pangloss/wiki/%5Ben%5D-Batch-download)). 

Preprocessed version 0.9 of the data set (in the folder named v0dot9_Jan2018) was created by Oliver Adams. It was hosted, at one point, [here](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/hBWwp9pFrHVx21i/download) (simply note the change of the directory name from \<feat\> to \<wav\>).

These preprocessed sets were produced by means of Oliver Adams's script [na.py](https://github.com/persephone-tools/persephone/blob/master/persephone/datasets/na.py).
